This error occurs when using the `useNavigation` hook in React Navigation within a functional component that is not directly rendered by a React Navigation component.  The `useNavigation` hook relies on the context provided by a navigator (like `NavigationContainer` or a screen component from `react-navigation`). If the context isn't available, it returns `undefined`, leading to unexpected behavior or errors when trying to access navigation methods like `navigate`.
