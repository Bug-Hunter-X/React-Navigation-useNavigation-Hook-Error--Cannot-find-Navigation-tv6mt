The solution involves ensuring that the component using `useNavigation` is rendered within a component that has access to the navigation context. This is usually a screen component provided by a React Navigation library like `react-navigation`. If the component needs to be accessed from a different part of the app, you may need to pass navigation props down through the component tree.  Another solution may involve using a context provider to provide the navigation object more broadly, but this is generally less preferred. 

```javascript
// useNavigationSolution.js
import React from 'react';
import { NavigationContainer } from '@react-navigation/native';
import { createNativeStackNavigator } from '@react-navigation/native-stack';
import { useNavigation } from '@react-navigation/native';

const MyScreen = () => {
  const navigation = useNavigation();
  const navigateToDetails = () => {
    navigation.navigate('Details');
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <Button title="Go to Details" onPress={navigateToDetails} />
    </View>
  );
};

const Stack = createNativeStackNavigator();

const App = () => {
  return (
    <NavigationContainer>
      <Stack.Navigator>
        <Stack.Screen name="Home" component={MyScreen} />
        <Stack.Screen name="Details" component={() => <Text>Details Screen</Text>} />
      </Stack.Navigator>
    </NavigationContainer>
  );
};

export default App;
```
