This repository demonstrates a common error in React Navigation where the `useNavigation` hook throws an error because it's used outside a valid navigation context.  The `useNavigationError.js` file shows the problematic code, while `useNavigationSolution.js` provides the corrected implementation.  The error is typically a type error indicating that navigation is undefined. This usually happens if the component is deeply nested or not a direct child of a component that provides the navigation context.
